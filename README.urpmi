This package includes BETA version of ifcfg-mdv system settings plugin,
which adds support for Mandriva-specific interface configuration to
NetworkManager.

To enable interface to be managed by NetworkManager set "Allow interface
to be controlled by Network Manager" using Mandriva Control Center.
This interface will then be skipped by ifup and ifdown commands.

You can find the current code in GIT repository at
git://git.mandriva.com/projects/networkmanager.git in branch mdv.
